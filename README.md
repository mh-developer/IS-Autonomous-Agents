# Autonomous Agents

## Main idea

We created simulation of fish flock. In first part we shows how it work steering of one vehicle. In second part we create flock/swarm and add algorithms for cohesion, alignment and separation.

## Content

We tried to simulate algorithms which we learned by the book of Daniel Shiffman.

## Steering

We created autonomous agents which simulate principles of "search and land", "natural walking" and "stay within walls" steering behavior.

## Flock of fish

We upgraded steering behavior of autonomous agents with group behaviors. 

We consider to the three rules of flocking:
- Separation (also known as "avoidance"): Steer to avoid colliding with your neighbors.
- Alignment (also known as "copy"): Steer in the same direction as your neighbors.
- Cohesion (also known as "center"): Steer towards the center of your neighbors (stay with the group).
